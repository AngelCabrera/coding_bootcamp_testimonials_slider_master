# Challenge from Frontend Mentor - Fylo data storage component

![Design preview for the Fylo data storage component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
